# ✦ Welcome to my GitHub

## About Me
I'm Matu — an artist, programmer, and someone who builds things with intention.  
I'm currently finishing my studies at Instituto Técnico Renault, with a solid foundation in programming and technology. I have hands-on experience with **HTML**, **CSS**, **Java**, **MySQL**, **C++**, **Python**, **Linux**, and **Git/GitHub**, plus a good grip on frontend development and agile methodologies.

Outside the code, I create, experiment, and dive deep into ideas. I like solving problems with logic, persistence, and a bit of edge. I’ve taken part in projects and competitions where I mix creativity with technical skill, always aiming for solutions that feel both functional and original.

I'm dedicated, curious, and I take initiative — I enjoy tackling new challenges and pushing myself into unfamiliar territory. I'm always open to learning, collaborating, and growing in any space that values innovation, responsibility, and ideas with purpose.

There’s also a more personal layer to my work: I come from art, heavy music, and gothic/alternative subcultures. That influence creeps into the things I make — darker aesthetics, clean structure, and a sense of atmosphere.

## ✦ What I’m Into
Dark worlds, introspective characters, heavy riffs, clean code, and ideas that feel alive.  
If I’m not programming, I’m probably drawing, cooking, playing guitar, or thinking too much about something.
